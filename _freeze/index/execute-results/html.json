A set of criteria facilitates informed-decisions to improve city resilience by identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructures in the road network to access healthcare facilities. (a) An assessment of the network analysis and accessibility access to healthcare facilities before and after a disaster (b) identifies critical infrastructures (c).\n\nThe **research objective** is to improve urban resilience by identifying critical infrastructures necessary for accessing healthcare facilities, comparing road connectivity and accessibility. The following research questions are addressed in this study:\n\n## Research questions\n\n1. How did the road connectivity of the city network change after being impacted by the floodings in Rio Grande do Sul based on Edge Betweenness Centrality?\n2. Which healthcare facilities were most affected by the floodings based on\naccessibility metrics?\n3. In which area of a cityâ€™s network should decisions be made to reinforce or redesign routes to optimize healthcare accessibility and ensure minimal disruption during flood events?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Gannt Chart\n\n",
