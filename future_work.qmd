### Flood mask

Using the dilate and erode method described in the slide 95/187 ([link](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2283855/PostGIS%20Day%202019%20-%20Overview.pdf)) could remove small islands that increase the computational costs. A use case of this technique is observed when simplifying coastlines ([link](https://github.com/rruiz-s/heigit-gima/wiki/2.-Data-preparation#post-scenario))
