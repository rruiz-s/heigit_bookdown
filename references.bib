	abstract = {The demand for reproducible research is on the rise in disciplines concerned with data analysis and computational methods. Therefore, we reviewed current recommendations for reproducible research and translated them into criteria for assessing the reproducibility of articles in the field of geographic information science ({GIScience}). Using this criteria, we assessed a sample of {GIScience} studies from the Association of Geographic Information Laboratories in Europe ({AGILE}) conference series, and we collected feedback about the assessment from the study authors. Results from the author feedback indicate that although authors support the concept of performing reproducible research, the incentives for doing this in practice are too small. Therefore, we propose concrete actions for individual researchers and the {GIScience} conference series to improve transparency and reproducibility. For example, to support researchers in producing reproducible work, the {GIScience} conference series could offer awards and paper badges, provide author guidelines for computational research, and publish articles in Open Access formats.},

The origin of this format is somewhat hazy; however, Louis Pasteur is said to be the first person who published his work in this format.

Visuals can cut through the noise and make it easier for readers to recognize and recall information. Yet many researchers were never taught how to present their work visually. This book details essential strategies to create more effective data visualizations. Jonathan Schwabish walks readers through the steps of creating better graphs and how to move beyond simple line, bar, and pie charts. Through more than five hundred examples, he demonstrates the do's and don'ts of data visualization, the principles of visual perception, and how to make subjective style decisions around a chart's design. Schwabish surveys more than eighty visualization types, from histograms to horizon charts, ridgeline plots to choropleth maps, and explains how each has its place in the visual toolkit. It might seem intimidating, but everyone can learn how to create compelling, effective data visualizations. This book will guide you as you define your audience and goals, choose the graph that best fits for your data, and clearly communicate your message"--},

{ABSTRACT}
Didactic tutorage is a quality agent that is related to the academic performance of students, and therefore is an integral part of the intra-classroom environment that the teacher of the Academic Units promotes as part of their daily work, research that analyzed their correlation between the students as teachers of the sixth and seventh years of Basic General Education ({EGB}) of the "Federico Bazurto Bravo Educational Unit", an inquiry that starts from a bibliographic review of the historical evolution of the word "tutoring", and specifies the characteristics of the academic performance of students, highlighting the role of the Tutor in academic performance, a study that was based on the inductive and deductive method, which allowed us to analyze the influence of the tutorial action on the students' academic performance, the application of the surveys assented us to reach conclusions that relate the tutorial action with cognitive processes that help the dynamisation of the attitude of both students and teachers.

Su implantación requiere que la dirección como líder formal del centro inicie procesos de cambio internos, que redunden tanto en la organización como en la cultura escolar. {MÉTODO}. El presente artículo se corresponde con una revisión sistemática referida a modalidades distribuidas de liderazgo, encabezadas por los líderes medios (fundamentalmente jefes de departamento o coordinadores pedagógicos). Para ello, se siguieron los parámetros promovidos por la declaración {PRISMA}, para asegurar la cientificidad a lo largo de todo el proceso. Tras la revisión realizada en las bases de datos Web of Science y Scopus, aparecieron 18 artículos. {RESULTADOS}. Entre los resultados hallados se encontró que las figuras intermedias de la organización educativa tienen una capacidad real de liderazgo cuando se promueve una cultura de colaboración en el centro y se establecen unas metas compartidas. Asimismo, se establece una relación positiva entre una cultura de colaboración y una mejora del desarrollo profesional del profesorado, que unido da lugar a mejoras en el rendimiento académico del alumnado. {DISCUSIÓN}. La principal conclusión de esta investigación es la importancia de incentivar un ambiente de colaboración y confianza en el centro educativo, mediado por una buena gestión de la dirección en esta encrucijada. Igualmente, es importante que exista una buena disposición del profesorado para trabajar con sus compañeros e implicarse en un proyecto común, dirigido a la mejora.

La metodología de la investigación fue mixta. Se recolectó, analizó y vinculó datos cuantitativos y cualitativos para obtener mayor información complementaria sobre el fenómeno en estudio. Se utilizó el diseño cuasi experimental con diseño pre y postest, al trabajar con grupos intactos: grupo control y experimental. Esta metodología permite el tratamiento del fenómeno desde la perspectiva holística, al detectar elementos básicos y relevantes en diversas situaciones,estudiar las conductas de los estudiantes adolescentes al enfrentarlos a situaciones morales de conflicto con los valores, y en circunstancias que ponga en evidencia la autorregulación del comportamiento para determinar la decisión o disposición de losadolescentes de manera racional y autónoma. Los resultados obtenidos mediante la prueba t demostró que el programa fue efectivo en la autorregulación del comportamiento con un puntaje promedio del Grupo Control 100.70 y del Grupo Experimental corresponde a 129.30 y el nivel de significancia reflejan un resultado significativo (sig. 0.000 {\textless} 0.05).
This study proposes a model of experiential intervention that allows High School students to self-regulate their behavior for the adequate personal development in the adolescence. The methodology of the research was mixed. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, analyzed and linked to obtaining complementary information on the phenomenon under study. We used the quasi-experimental design with pre and posttest design when working with intact groups: control and experimental group. This methodology allows the treatment of the phenomenon from a holistic perspective, by detecting basic and relevant elements in different situations, studying the behaviors of students when confronted with moral situations of conflict with values, and in circumstances that show self-regulation of the behavior to determine the decision or disposition of the adolescents in a rational and autonomous way. The results obtained through the t-test showed that the program was effective in self-regulation of behavior with an average score of Control Group 100.70 and the Experimental Group corresponding to 129.30 and the significance level reflects a significant result (0.000 {\textless}0.05).},

Para ello, el estudio pretende valorar la eficacia del desarrollo de las tutorías en Educación Secundaria Obligatoria y Postobligatoria y realizar un estudio diferencial en función de las distintas variables sociodemográficas seleccionadas (sexo, curso y tipo de centro). {MÉTODO}. Se ha aplicado un cuestionario a 4.254 estudiantes de la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid. Dentro de las tutorías se analizan las funciones del tutor con el alumnado, las funciones del tutor con la familia, el desarrollo y la evaluación de las tutorías. {RESULTADOS}. Se evidencia una valoración de nivel medio sobre la eficacia del desarrollo de las tutorías, siendo los ítems centrados en las funciones del tutor con el alumnado (3,39) mejor valorados y los ítems que hacen referencia al desarrollo de las tutorías (2,92) los que obtienen medias más bajas. Asimismo, los estudiantes de los primeros cursos de la educación secundaria valoran con un nivel más alto la eficacia de las tutorías. {DISCUSIÓN}. Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que los aspectos que mayor grado de atención requieren en el desarrollo de las tutorías en los centros educativos son: la participación de la comunidad educativa (profesorado, alumnado y familias), el desarrollo de actividades académicas y profesionales, así como aquellas centradas en su desarrollo social y personal. Igualmente, la necesidad de plantear procesos de evaluación que mejoren la planificación y desarrollo de las tutorías y las programaciones de aula en los centros educativos.},

	abstract = {The transition from Primary to Secondary Education is a critical moment for students, as this period between educational stages implies for some of them the beginning of a process that can lead to school failure. The outcomes of this transition process will depend, among other factors, on teachers´ perceptions, attitudes and actions. This paper aims to identify and analyze the factors that, from the teachers´ perspective, can facilitate or hinder the transition process from Primary to Secondary Education. The methodology used is based on a qualitative approach, developed through focus groups and interviews with tutors of the first year of Obligatory Secondary Education, headmasters, management teams and high school counselors. Data and opinion analysis expose the most significant elements in the transition process. School organization and school culture emerge as key aspects, since most of the teachers identify factors belonging to those areas. In line with other studies, communication between schools, students and families as well as tutoring arise as essential aspects in the transition process from Primary to Secondary Education. Finally, this study will underscore the importance of knowing these factors to improve the process.
            El periodo de transición de Educación primaria a secundaria se configura como un momento crítico para el alumnado, ya que en ocasiones supone el inicio de un proceso que puede conducir al fracaso escolar. De las percepciones, actitudes y actuaciones del profesorado, entre otros factores, dependerá el desarrollo de ese proceso. El presente artículo tiene como objetivo identificar y analizarlos factores que, desde el punto de vista de los/as docentes, facilitan y dificultan la transición de primaria a secundaria. La metodología utilizada, basada en un enfoque predominantemente cualitativo, a través de grupos de discusión y entrevistas con tutores/as de 1º de {ESO}, equipos directivos y orientadores/as de Centros de Educación Secundaria, ha permitido detectar y profundizar en los elementos clave del proceso. La organización escolar y la cultura escolar aparecen como aspectos claves, situándose en esos ámbitos la mayoría de los factores señalados por los/as docentes. En línea con otros estudios, se mostrará la importancia de la comunicación entre centros educativos-alumnado-familias y el papel esencial de la tutoría en la transición. Se concluirá incidiendo en la relevancia de conocer e intervenir sobre los factores que pueden contribuir a la mejora del proceso.},

This book explains the background, the value, the implementation and the application of Iso 21500 for each type of organization. It describes what you, as a customer, supplier, manager or member of project staff, can do or maybe should do with the guideline. The book supplies answers to the 100 most common asked questions about Iso 21500 with the focus on the value of the guideline for the project management practice. The target audience of this book includes: ? Senior managers and project sponsors, so that they gain a better understanding of the principles and practice of project management and therefore provide appropriate support and guidance to their project managers, project management teams, and the project teams; ? Project managers, project management teams, and project team members, so that they have a common base of comparison of their project standards and practices with those of others; ? Developers of national or organizational standards, for use in developing project management standards, which are consistent at a core level with those of others. ? Consultants, educators, coaches and trainers in the project management discipline. They can connect various generally known and bespoke project management methods, models and best practices to the Iso 21500 framework as a common frame of reference.},

Using a case study approach research was undertaken with students participating in an online mentoring module that forms part of a Masters degree at a British university. The module involves students in ‘meeting’ and working online, via e-mail, with a mentor whom they have never met face-to-face. From the research collected to date it is possible to conclude that there is evidence to suggest that the use of {NVC}, with its focus on feelings and needs, encourages trusting personal relationships characterised by openness. The {NVC} process appeared to obviate many of the communication issues, such as silence and the affects of a limited sensory environment, that have seen to be restrictive in the development of online relationships.},

The two languages being discussed describe two different types of rhetoric and, at the same time, two opposite communication/social rituals used by people in their everyday life and also in the mass media, and omnipresent in the advertisement. The paper tries to draw attention that contemporary media is based on “jackal language” (often strongly rooted in our culture and mentality) being a language of violence, blocking empathy and stimulating conflicts and tension in interpersonal communication and relationships). Unfortunately media makes a tremendous impact on the customers (especially on young people). This paper aims to propagate and encourage using the “giraffe language” described as the language of love, understanding and clemency.

As one of the breeds listed in the National List of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources Protection, the protection of its germplasm resources is particularly important. However, the existing breeding and protection methods for them are relatively simple, due to the weak technical force and lack of intelligent means to assist. Most livestock farmers still conduct small-scale breeding in primitive ways, which is not conducive to the breeding and protection of Chengdu ma goats. In this paper, an automatic individual recognition method for Chengdu ma goats is proposed, which saves labor costs and does not depend on large-scale mechanized facilities. The main contributions of our work are as follows: (1) a new Chengdu ma goat dataset is built, which forms the basis for object detection and classification tasks; (2) an improved detection algorithm for Chengdu ma goats based on {TPH}-{YOLOv}5 is proposed, which is able to accurately localize goats in high-density scenes with severe scale variance of targets; (3) a classifier incorporating a self-supervised learning module is implemented to improve the classification performance without increasing the labeled data and inference computation overhead. Experiments show that our method is able to accurately recognize Chengdu ma goats in the actual indoor barn breeding environment, which lays the foundation for precision feeding based on sex and age.},

This paper presents {SAM}-{PT}, a method extending {SAM}'s capability to tracking and segmenting anything in dynamic videos. {SAM}-{PT} leverages robust and sparse point selection and propagation techniques for mask generation, demonstrating that a {SAM}-based segmentation tracker can yield strong zero-shot performance across popular video object segmentation benchmarks, including {DAVIS}, {YouTube}-{VOS}, and {MOSE}. Compared to traditional object-centric mask propagation strategies, we uniquely use point propagation to exploit local structure information that is agnostic to object semantics. We highlight the merits of point-based tracking through direct evaluation on the zero-shot open-world Unidentified Video Objects ({UVO}) benchmark. To further enhance our approach, we utilize K-Medoids clustering for point initialization and track both positive and negative points to clearly distinguish the target object. We also employ multiple mask decoding passes for mask refinement and devise a point re-initialization strategy to improve tracking accuracy. Our code integrates different point trackers and video segmentation benchmarks and will be released at https://github.com/{SysCV}/sam-pt.},

Additionally, {SAM}-Track employs multimodal interaction methods that enable users to select multiple objects in videos for tracking, corresponding to their specific requirements. These interaction methods comprise click, stroke, and text, each possessing unique benefits and capable of being employed in combination. As a result, {SAM}-Track can be used across an array of fields, ranging from drone technology, autonomous driving, medical imaging, augmented reality, to biological analysis. {SAM}-Track amalgamates Segment Anything Model ({SAM}), an interactive key-frame segmentation model, with our proposed {AOT}-based tracking model ({DeAOT}), which secured 1st place in four tracks of the {VOT} 2022 challenge, to facilitate object tracking in video. In addition, {SAM}-Track incorporates Grounding-{DINO}, which enables the framework to support text-based interaction. We have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of {SAM}-Track on {DAVIS}-2016 Val (92.0\%), {DAVIS}-2017 Test (79.2\%)and its practicability in diverse applications.

However, it does not consistently achieve satisfying performance for dense instance object segmentation, even with 20 prompts (clicks/boxes) on each image.

	abstract = {The Segment Anything Model ({SAM}) has gained significant attention for its impressive performance in image segmentation. However, it lacks proficiency in referring video object segmentation ({RVOS}) due to the need for precise user-interactive prompts and limited understanding of different modalities, such as language and vision. This paper presents the {RefSAM} model, which for the first time explores the potential of {SAM} for {RVOS} by incorporating multi-view information from diverse modalities and successive frames at different timestamps. Our proposed approach adapts the original {SAM} model to enhance cross-modality learning by employing a lightweight Cross-Modal {MLP} that projects the text embedding of the referring expression into sparse and dense embeddings, serving as user-interactive prompts. Subsequently, a parameter-efficient tuning strategy is employed to effectively align and fuse the language and vision features. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the practical and effective design choices of our strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on Ref-Youtu-{VOS} and Ref-{DAVIS}17 datasets validate the superiority and effectiveness of our {RefSAM} model over existing methods.

	abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of object counting in images. Existing approaches rely on extensive training data with point annotations for each object, making data collection labor-intensive and time-consuming. To overcome this, we propose a training-free object counter that treats the counting task as a segmentation problem. Our approach leverages the Segment Anything Model ({SAM}), known for its high-quality masks and zero-shot segmentation capability. However, the vanilla mask generation method of {SAM} lacks class-specific information in the masks, resulting in inferior counting accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a prior-guided mask generation method that incorporates three types of priors into the segmentation process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we tackle the issue of counting objects specified through text by proposing a two-stage approach that combines reference object selection and prior-guided mask generation. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our training-free counter compared to learning-based approaches. This paper presents a promising solution for counting objects in various scenarios without the need for extensive data collection and counting-specific training.

	abstract = {Unsupervised video object segmentation has made significant progress in recent years, but the manual annotation of video mask datasets is expensive and limits the diversity of available datasets. The Segment Anything Model ({SAM}) has introduced a new prompt-driven paradigm for image segmentation, unlocking a range of previously unexplored capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm called {UVOSAM}, which leverages {SAM} for unsupervised video object segmentation without requiring video mask labels. To address {SAM}'s limitations in instance discovery and identity association, we introduce a video salient object tracking network that automatically generates trajectories for prominent foreground objects. These trajectories then serve as prompts for {SAM} to produce video masks on a frame-by-frame basis. Our experimental results demonstrate that {UVOSAM} significantly outperforms current mask-supervised methods. These findings suggest that {UVOSAM} has the potential to improve unsupervised video object segmentation and reduce the cost of manual annotation.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) is evolving towards artificial general intelligence, which refers to the ability of an {AI} system to perform a wide range of tasks and exhibit a level of intelligence similar to that of a human being. This is in contrast to narrow or specialized {AI}, which is designed to perform specific tasks with a high degree of efficiency. Therefore, it is urgent to design a general class of models, which we term foundation models, trained on broad data that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. The recently proposed segment anything model ({SAM}) has made significant progress in breaking the boundaries of segmentation, greatly promoting the development of foundation models for computer vision. To fully comprehend {SAM}, we conduct a survey study. As the first to comprehensively review the progress of segmenting anything task for vision and beyond based on the foundation model of {SAM}, this work focuses on its applications to various tasks and data types by discussing its historical development, recent progress, and profound impact on broad applications. We first introduce the background and terminology for foundation models including {SAM}, as well as state-of-the-art methods contemporaneous with {SAM} that are significant for segmenting anything task. Then, we analyze and summarize the advantages and limitations of {SAM} across various image processing applications, including software scenes, real-world scenes, and complex scenes. Importantly, many insights are drawn to guide future research to develop more versatile foundation models and improve the architecture of {SAM}. We also summarize massive other amazing applications of {SAM} in vision and beyond. Finally, we maintain a continuously updated paper list and an open-source project summary for foundation model {SAM} at {\textbackslash}href\{https://github.com/liliu-avril/Awesome-Segment-Anything\}\{{\textbackslash}color\{magenta\}\{here\}\}.},

The objective is to accomplish diverse tasks according to the context, rather than relying on specific colors. After training, {SegGPT} can perform arbitrary segmentation tasks in images or videos via in-context inference, such as object instance, stuff, part, contour, and text. {SegGPT} is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Our results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.},

Trained on a large segmentation dataset of over 1 billion masks, {SAM} is capable of segmenting any object on a certain image. In the original {SAM} work, the authors turned to zero-short transfer tasks (like edge detection) for evaluating the performance of {SAM}. Recently, numerous works have attempted to investigate the performance of {SAM} in various scenarios to recognize and segment objects. Moreover, numerous projects have emerged to show the versatility of {SAM} as a foundation model by combining it with other models, like Grounding {DINO}, Stable Diffusion, {ChatGPT}, etc. With the relevant papers and projects increasing exponentially, it is challenging for the readers to catch up with the development of {SAM}. To this end, this work conducts the first yet comprehensive survey on {SAM}. This is an ongoing project and we intend to update the manuscript on a regular basis.

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective audio-visual localization and segmentation framework based on the Segment Anything Model, namely {AV}-{SAM}, that can generate sounding object masks corresponding to the audio. Specifically, our {AV}-{SAM} simply leverages pixel-wise audio-visual fusion across audio features and visual features from the pre-trained image encoder in {SAM} to aggregate cross-modal representations. Then, the aggregated cross-modal features are fed into the prompt encoder and mask decoder to generate the final audio-visual segmentation masks. We conduct extensive experiments on Flickr-{SoundNet} and {AVSBench} datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed {AV}-{SAM} can achieve competitive performance on sounding object localization and segmentation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06798},
	abstract = {Large pre-trained models, also known as foundation models ({FMs}), are trained in a task-agnostic manner on large-scale data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks by fine-tuning, few-shot, or even zero-shot learning. Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet seen an attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence ({GeoAI}). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing multimodal foundation models for {GeoAI}. We first investigate the potential of many existing {FMs} by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location description recognition, and {US} state-level/county-level dementia time series forecasting, these task-agnostic {LLMs} can outperform task-specific fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However, on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data modalities (e.g., {POI}-based urban function classification, street view image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major challenges of developing a {FM} for {GeoAI} is to address the multimodality nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal foundation model which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial alignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks and challenges to develop such a model for {GeoAI}.},

	abstract = {Recently, the first foundation model developed specifically for vision tasks was developed, termed the "Segment Anything Model" ({SAM}). {SAM} can segment objects in input imagery based upon cheap input prompts, such as one (or more) points, a bounding box, or a mask. The authors examined the zero-shot image segmentation accuracy of {SAM} on a large number of vision benchmark tasks and found that {SAM} usually achieved recognition accuracy similar to, or sometimes exceeding, vision models that had been trained on the target tasks. The impressive generalization of {SAM} for segmentation has major implications for vision researchers working on natural imagery. In this work, we examine whether {SAM}'s impressive performance extends to overhead imagery problems, and help guide the community's response to its development. We examine {SAM}'s performance on a set of diverse and widely-studied benchmark tasks. We find that {SAM} does often generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases due to the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and the target objects. We report on these unique systematic failure cases for remote sensing imagery that may comprise useful future research for the community.

The big data, robots and smart sensing technologies have brought the autonomous robotic system to the smart farming that enhance productivity and efficiency. Therefore, a {YOLOv}4-{SAM} was proposed to achieve high detection precision of cow body parts in long-term complex scenes. The proposed {YOLOv}4-{SAM} consists of two components: {YOLOv}4 is for multi-scale feature extraction, while the Spatial Attention Mechanisms ({SAM}) highlights the key cow biometric-related features. By doing this, visual biometric feature representation ability is enhanced for improving cow detection performance. To verify the performance of {YOLOv}4-{SAM}, a challenging dataset consisting of adult cows and calves with complex environments (e.g., day and night, occlusion, multiple target) was constructed for experimental testing. The precision, recall, {mIoU} and  of the proposed {YOLOv}4-{CBAM} were 92.29\%, 96.51\%, 77.22\% and 93.13\%, respectively. The data shows that its overall performance was better than that of the comparison algorithm (Faster R-{CNN}, {RetinaNet} and {YOLOv}4). In addition, object detection based on the {YOLOv}4-{SAM} model can capture the key biometric-related features for cow visual representation and improve the performance of cow detection. In addition, the detected height difference between head and leg proved the capability in automatic identification of lame cows. The proposed deep learning-based cow detection approach provides a basis for developing an automated system for animal monitoring and management on commercial dairy farms.},

	abstract = {Class-agnostic object counting aims to count object instances of an arbitrary class at test time. It is challenging but also enables many potential applications. Current methods require human-annotated exemplars as inputs which are often unavailable for novel categories, especially for autonomous systems. Thus, we propose zero-shot object counting ({ZSC}), a new setting where only the class name is available during test time. Such a counting system does not require human annotators in the loop and can operate automatically. Starting from a class name, we propose a method that can accurately identify the optimal patches which can then be used as counting exemplars. Specifically, we first construct a class prototype to select the patches that are likely to contain the objects of interest, namely class-relevant patches. Furthermore, we introduce a model that can quantitatively measure how suitable an arbitrary patch is as a counting exemplar. By applying this model to all the candidate patches, we can select the most suitable patches as exemplars for counting. Experimental results on a recent class-agnostic counting dataset, {FSC}-147, validate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/zero-shot-counting},

	abstract = {We present {SegGPT}, a generalist model for segmenting everything in context. We unify various segmentation tasks into a generalist in-context learning framework that accommodates different kinds of segmentation data by transforming them into the same format of images. The training of {SegGPT} is formulated as an in-context coloring problem with random color mapping for each data sample. The objective is to accomplish diverse tasks according to the context, rather than relying on specific colors. After training, {SegGPT} can perform arbitrary segmentation tasks in images or videos via in-context inference, such as object instance, stuff, part, contour, and text. {SegGPT} is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Our results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.},

                  Methods for collecting animal behaviour data in natural environments, such as direct observation and biologging, are typically limited in spatiotemporal resolution, the number of animals that can be observed and information about animals' social and physical environments.
                
                
                  Video imagery can capture rich information about animals and their environments, but image‐based approaches are often impractical due to the challenges of processing large and complex multi‐image datasets and transforming resulting data, such as animals' locations, into geographical coordinates.
                
                
                  We demonstrate a new system for studying behaviour in the wild that uses drone‐recorded videos and computer vision approaches to automatically track the location and body posture of free‐roaming animals in georeferenced coordinates with high spatiotemporal resolution embedded in contemporaneous 3D landscape models of the surrounding area.
                
                
                  We provide two worked examples in which we apply this approach to videos of gelada monkeys and multiple species of group‐living African ungulates. We demonstrate how to track multiple animals simultaneously, classify individuals by species and age–sex class, estimate individuals' body postures (poses) and extract environmental features, including topography of the landscape and animal trails.
                
                
                  By quantifying animal movement and posture while reconstructing a detailed 3D model of the landscape, our approach opens the door to studying the sensory ecology and decision‐making of animals within their natural physical and social environments.},

The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results.

	shorttitle = {Unidentified Video Objects},
	abstract = {Current state-of-the-art object detection and segmentation methods work well under the closed-world assumption. This closed-world setting assumes that the list of object categories is available during training and deployment. However, many real-world applications require detecting or segmenting novel objects, i.e., object categories never seen during training. In this paper, we present, {UVO} (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. Besides shifting the problem focus to the open-world setup, {UVO} is significantly larger, providing approximately 8 times more videos compared with {DAVIS}, and 7 times more mask (instance) annotations per video compared with {YouTube}-{VOS} and {YouTube}-{VIS}. {UVO} is also more challenging as it includes many videos with crowded scenes and complex background motions. We demonstrated that {UVO} can be used for other applications, such as object tracking and super-voxel segmentation, besides open-world object segmentation. We believe that {UVo} is a versatile testbed for researchers to develop novel approaches for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation, and inspires new research directions towards a more comprehensive video understanding beyond classification and detection.},

	abstract = {This report presents a framework called Segment And Track Anything ({SAMTrack}) that allows users to precisely and effectively segment and track any object in a video. Additionally, {SAM}-Track employs multimodal interaction methods that enable users to select multiple objects in videos for tracking, corresponding to their specific requirements. These interaction methods comprise click, stroke, and text, each possessing unique benefits and capable of being employed in combination. As a result, {SAM}-Track can be used across an array of fields, ranging from drone technology, autonomous driving, medical imaging, augmented reality, to biological analysis. {SAM}-Track amalgamates Segment Anything Model ({SAM}), an interactive key-frame segmentation model, with our proposed {AOT}-based tracking model ({DeAOT}), which secured 1st place in four tracks of the {VOT} 2022 challenge, to facilitate object tracking in video. In addition, {SAM}-Track incorporates Grounding-{DINO}, which enables the framework to support text-based interaction. We have demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of {SAM}-Track on {DAVIS}-2016 Val (92.0\%), {DAVIS}-2017 Test (79.2\%)and its practicability in diverse applications.

	abstract = {The recent Segment Anything Model ({SAM}) represents a big leap in scaling up segmentation models, allowing for powerful zero-shot capabilities and flexible prompting. Despite being trained with 1.1 billion masks, {SAM}'s mask prediction quality falls short in many cases, particularly when dealing with objects that have intricate structures. We propose {HQ}-{SAM}, equipping {SAM} with the ability to accurately segment any object, while maintaining {SAM}'s original promptable design, efficiency, and zero-shot generalizability. Our careful design reuses and preserves the pre-trained model weights of {SAM}, while only introducing minimal additional parameters and computation. We design a learnable High-Quality Output Token, which is injected into {SAM}'s mask decoder and is responsible for predicting the high-quality mask. Instead of only applying it on mask-decoder features, we first fuse them with early and final {ViT} features for improved mask details. To train our introduced learnable parameters, we compose a dataset of 44K fine-grained masks from several sources. {HQ}-{SAM} is only trained on the introduced detaset of 44k masks, which takes only 4 hours on 8 {GPUs}. We show the efficacy of {HQ}-{SAM} in a suite of 9 diverse segmentation datasets across different downstream tasks, where 7 out of them are evaluated in a zero-shot transfer protocol. Our code and models will be released at https://github.com/{SysCV}/{SAM}-{HQ}.},

                  Animal abundance data are essential for endangered species conservation, tracking invasive species spread, biosecurity, agricultural applications and wildlife monitoring; however, obtaining abundance data are a perennial challenge. Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image‐processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large‐bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology.
                
                
                  We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals.
                
                
                  Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi‐automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high‐resolution data.
                
                
                  Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.},

Typically, such conservation tasks are performed manually on foot or after an aerial recording from a manned aircraft. Such manual approaches are expensive, slow and labor intensive. In this paper, we investigate the combination of small unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs} or “drones”) with automatic object recognition techniques as a viable solution to manual animal surveying. Since no controlled data is available, we record our own animal conservation dataset with a quadcopter drone. We evaluate two nature conservation tasks: (i) animal detection (ii) animal counting using three state-of-the-art generic object recognition methods that are particularly well-suited for on-board detection. Results show that object detection techniques for human-scale photographs do not directly translate to a drone perspective, but that light-weight automatic object detection techniques are promising for nature conservation tasks.},

Many Precision Dairy Farming technologies, including daily milk yield recording, milk component monitoring, pedometers, automatic temperature recording devices, milk conductivity indicators, automatic estrus detection monitors, and daily body weight measurements, are already being utilized by dairy producers. Other theoretical Precision Dairy Farming technologies have been proposed to measure jaw movements, ruminal {pH}, reticular contractions, heart rate, animal positioning and activity, vaginal mucus electrical resistance, feeding behavior, lying behavior, odor, glucose, acoustics, progesterone, individual milk components, color (as an indicator of cleanliness), infrared udder surface temperatures, and respiration rates. The main objectives of Precision Dairy Farming are maximizing individual animal potential, early detection of disease, and minimizing the use of medication through preventive health measures. Perceived benefits of Precision Dairy Farming technologies include increased efficiency, reduced costs, improved product quality, minimized adverse environmental impacts, and improved animal health and well-being. Real time data used for monitoring animals may be incorporated into decision support systems designed to facilitate decision making for issues that require compilation of multiple sources of data. Technologies for physiological monitoring of dairy cows have great potential to supplement the observational activities of skilled herdspersons, which is especially critical as more cows are managed by fewer skilled workers. Moreover, data provided by these technologies may be incorporated into genetic evaluations for non-production traits aimed at improving animal health, well-being, and longevity. The economic implications of technology adoption must be explored further to increase adoption rates of Precision Dairy Farming technologies. Precision Dairy Farming may prove to be the next important technological breakthrough for the dairy industry.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, small unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}/drones) have become increasingly popular in the airborne observation of large areas for many purposes, such as the monitoring of agricultural areas, the tracking of wild animals in their natural habitats, and the counting of livestock. Coupled with deep learning, they allow for automatic image processing and recognition. The aim of this work was to detect and count the deer population in northwestern Serbia from such images using deep neural networks, a tedious process that otherwise requires a lot of time and effort. In this paper, we present and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art network architectures, trained on a manually annotated set of images, and use it to predict the presence of objects in the rest of the dataset. We implemented three versions of the You Only Look Once ({YOLO}) architecture and a Single Shot Multibox Detector ({SSD}) to detect deer in a dense forest environment and measured their performance based on mean average precision ({mAP}), precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, we also evaluated the models based on their real-time performance. The results showed that the selected models were able to detect deer with a mean average precision of up to 70.45\% and a confidence score of up to a 99\%. The highest precision was achieved by the fourth version of {YOLO} with 86\%, as well as the highest recall value of 75\%. Its compressed version achieved slightly lower results, with 83\% {mAP} in its best case, but it demonstrated four times better real-time performance. The counting function was applied on the best-performing models, providing us with the exact distribution of deer over all images. Yolov4 obtained an error of 8.3\% in counting, while Yolov4-tiny mistook 12 deer, which accounted for an error of 7.1\%.},

	abstract = {The cumulative impact of human activities has driven many species into severe declines across the globe. However, the recent focus on conservation optimism has begun to highlight case studies that go against this trend. Reforestation, agricultural abandonment, reintroduction and legislative change have led to a situation where large mammals have recovered and are now widespread across the European continent. This study summarizes the knowledge about wild ungulate distribution in Europe and review the diversity of ways in which they interact with humans. Drawn from a wide range of sources, we built distribution maps of European wild ungulates. Results show that 90\% of Europe is home to at least 1 species of wild native ungulate, with roe deer and wild boar occupying 74\% and 64\% of Europe respectively. In contrast, wild native mountain ungulates only occupy 5\% of Europe, and are often associated with protected areas. The wide distribution of most European ungulates combined with the extensive human activity within Europe result in a wide range of interactions between ungulates and humans. These interactions can be classified as services or disservices depending on the value orientation and economic position of the various stakeholders perceiving this relationship. Overall, our survey highlights the success of wildlife management policies in Europe and the potential for continental scale conservation of large mammals in human-dominated landscapes. However, maintaining the success of wild ungulate conservation requires actions from national and European institutions to improve coordinated management across jurisdictional borders and sectorial coordination for the whole landscape.},

	shorttitle = {Can {SAM} Segment Anything?},
	abstract = {{SAM} is a segmentation model recently released by Meta {AI} Research and has been gaining attention quickly due to its impressive performance in generic object segmentation. However, its ability to generalize to specific scenes such as camouflaged scenes is still unknown. Camouflaged object detection ({COD}) involves identifying objects that are seamlessly integrated into their surroundings and has numerous practical applications in fields such as medicine, art, and agriculture. In this study, we try to ask if {SAM} can address the {COD} task and evaluate the performance of {SAM} on the {COD} benchmark by employing maximum segmentation evaluation and camouflage location evaluation. We also compare {SAM}'s performance with 22 state-of-the-art {COD} methods. Our results indicate that while {SAM} shows promise in generic object segmentation, its performance on the {COD} task is limited. This presents an opportunity for further research to explore how to build a stronger {SAM} that may address the {COD} task.

	abstract = {The Segment Anything Model ({SAM}) is a promptable segmentation model recently introduced by Meta {AI} that has demonstrated its prowess across various fields beyond just image segmentation. {SAM} can accurately segment images across diverse fields, and generating various masks. We discovered that this ability of {SAM} can be leveraged to pretrain models for specific fields. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that utilizes {SAM} to generate pseudo labels for pretraining thermal infrared image segmentation tasks. Our proposed framework can effectively improve the accuracy of segmentation results of specific categories beyond the {SOTA} {ImageNet} pretrained model. Our framework presents a novel approach to collaborate with models trained with large data like {SAM} to address problems in special fields. Also, we generated a large scale thermal infrared segmentation dataset used for pretaining, which contains over 100,000 images with pixel-annotation labels. This approach offers an effective solution for working with large models in special fields where label annotation is challenging. Our code is available at https://github.com/{chenjzBUAA}/{SATIR}},

In recent years, numerous public datasets have played significant roles in the advancement of autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}). However, these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: {UAVs} are limited in their payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements. To fill this gap, we create the "Giraffe" mapping robot based on a bucket truck, which is equipped with a variety of well-calibrated and synchronized sensors: four 3D {LiDARs}, two stereo cameras, two monocular cameras, Inertial Measurement Units ({IMUs}), and a {GNSS}/{INS} system. A laser tracker is used to record the millimeter-level ground truth positions. We also make its ground twin, the "Okapi" mapping robot, to gather data for comparison. The proposed dataset extends the typical autonomous driving sensing suite to aerial scenes, demonstrating the potential of combining autonomous driving perception systems with bucket trucks to create a versatile autonomous aerial working platform. Moreover, based on the Segment Anything Model ({SAM}), we produce the Semantic {FLICAR} dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for multimodal continuous data in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

            The dynamics of global energy and climate agenda progresses rapidly. The European Union has frequently taken an active role in international climate policy by developing relevant strategies in as early as the nineties the last century, and today promoting an ambitious {EU} Green Deal to become climate neutral by 2050. However, despite its ambition and recent success in meeting most 2020 goals, the {EU} does not have an easy schedule to progress on its climate and energy targets for 2030. Recognizing the transition, one of the scientific excellences European Organisation for Nuclear Research ({CERN}) published the first environmental report in the beginning of 2020. Through a wide range of environmental activities and clearly disseminated targets, this organisation actually brought to the table a discourse on how scientific organisation can be part of {EU} Green Deal actions and how to perform research within the scope of the environmental context. This article focuses on two concepts to contribute to larger discussions in both the research and governance communities, how researchers should conduct their science, and what respective responsibilities of researchers, their institutes, have in terms of European environmental policy. Literature was reviewed to find a theoretical approach to the environment, responsible innovation and science diplomacy. The research was developed through literature study to identify and describe the respective indicators as well as through an analysis of secondary sources whereby a previous attempt to collect and analyse other sources had been conducted by scholars in respect to the relationship between innovation and the environment.},

              Background
              The ability of disaster response, preparedness, and mitigation efforts to assess the loss of physical accessibility to health facilities and to identify impacted populations is key in reducing the humanitarian consequences of disasters. Recent studies use either network- or raster-based approaches to measure accessibility in respect to travel time. Our analysis compares a raster- and a network- based approach that both build on open data with respect to their ability to assess the loss of accessibility due to a severe flood event. As our analysis uses open access data, the approach should be transferable to other flood-prone sites to support decision-makers in the preparation of disaster mitigation and preparedness plans.
            
            
              Methods
              Our study is based on the flood events following Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019 and uses both raster- and network-based approaches to compare accessibility to health sites under normal conditions to the aftermath of the cyclone to assess the loss of accessibility. Part of the assessment is a modified centrality indicator, which identifies the specific use of the road network for the population to reach health facilities.
            
            
              Results
              Results for the raster- and the network-based approaches differed by about 300,000 inhabitants ({\textasciitilde} 800,000 to {\textasciitilde} 500,000) losing accessibility to healthcare sites. The discrepancy was related to the incomplete mapping of road networks and affected the network-based approach to a higher degree. The modified centrality indicator allowed us to identify road segments that were most likely to suffer from flooding and to highlight potential backup roads in disaster settings.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The different results obtained between the raster- and network-based methods indicate the importance of data quality assessments in addition to accessibility assessments as well as the importance of fostering mapping campaigns in large parts of the Global South. Data quality is therefore a key parameter when deciding which method is best suited for local conditions. Another important aspect is the required spatial resolution of the results. Identification of critical segments of the road network provides essential information to prepare for potential disasters.},

            Deprived settlements, usually referred to as slums, are often located in hazardous areas. However, there have been very few studies to examine this notion. In this study, we leverage the advancements in open geospatial data, earth observation ({EO}), and machine learning to create a multi-hazard susceptibility index and a transferrable disaster risk approach to be adapted in low- and middle-income country ({LMIC}) cities, with low-cost methods. Specifically, we identify multi-hazards in Nairobi's selected case study area and construct a susceptibility index. Then, we test the predictability of deprived settlements using the multi-hazard susceptibility index in comparison with {EO} texture-based methods. Lastly, we survey 100 households in two deprived settlements (typical and atypical slums) in Nairobi and use the survey outcomes to validate the multi-hazard susceptibility index. To test the assumption that deprived areas are dominantly located in areas with higher susceptibility to multiple hazards, we contrast morphologically identified deprived settlements with non-deprived settlements. We find that deprived settlements are generally more exposed to hazards. However, there are variations between central and peripheral settlements. In testing the predictability of deprivation using multi-hazards, the multi-hazard-based model performs better for deprived settlements than for other classes. In contrast, the texture-based model is better at classifying all types of morphological settlements. Lastly, by contrasting the survey outcomes to the household interviews, we conclude that proxies used for the multi-hazard susceptibility index adequately capture the hazards. However, more localized proxies can be used to improve the index performance.},

	abstract = {Natural hazards can present a significant risk to road infrastructure. This infrastructure is a fundamental component of the transportation infrastructure, with significant importance. During emergencies, society heavily relies on the functionality of the road infrastructure to facilitate evacuation and access to emergency facilities. This study introduces a versatile, multi-scale framework designed to analyze accessibility within road networks during natural hazard scenarios. The first module of the framework focuses on assessing the influence of natural hazards on road infrastructure to identify damaged or blocked road segments and intersections. It relies on near real-time information, often provided by citizen science through Volunteered Geographic Information ({VGI}) data and Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) of {VGI} texts. The second module conducts network analysis based on freely available Open Street Map ({OSM}) data, differentiating between intact and degraded road networks. Four accessibility measures are employed: betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, a free-flow assumption index, and a novel alternative routing assumption measure considering congestion scenarios. The study showcases its framework through an exemplary application in California, the United States, considering different hazard scenarios, where degraded roads and connected roads impacted by the hazard can be identified. The road extraction methodology allows the extraction of 75\% to 100\% of the impacted roads mentioned in {VGI} text messages for the respective case studies. In addition to the directly extracted impacted roads, constructing the degraded network also involves finding road segments that overlap with hazard impact zones, as these are at risk of being impacted. Conducting the network analysis with the four different measures on the intact and degraded network, changes in network accessibility due to the impacts of hazards can be identified. The results show that using each measure is justified, as each measure could demonstrate the accessibility change. However, their combination and comparison provide valuable insights. In conclusion, this study successfully addresses the challenges of developing a generic, complete framework from impact extraction to network analysis independently of the scale and characteristics of road network types.},

Major advancements have been made in the collaborative mapping of buildings with platforms like {OpenStreetMap}, however, many parts of the world still lack this information or the information is outdated. We created a semi-automated workflow for the development of elements-at-risk ({EaR}) databases of buildings by detecting building footprints using deep learning and characterising the footprints with building occupancy information using building morphological metrics and open-source auxiliary data. The deep learning model was used to detect building {EaR} footprints in a city in Kerala (India) with an F1 score of over 76\%. The footprints were classified into 13 building occupancy types along with information such as average number of floors, total floor space area, building density, and percentage of built-up area. We analysed the transferability of the approach to a different city in Kerala and obtained an almost similar F1 score of 74\%. We also examined the exposure of the buildings and the associated occupancies to floods using the 2018 flood susceptibility map of the respective cities.

              In response to the “Leave No One Behind” principle (the central promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development), reliable estimate of the total number of citizens living in slums is urgently needed but not available for some of the most vulnerable communities.

            The mapping and characterisation of building footprints is a challenging task due to inaccessibility and incompleteness of the required data, thus hindering the estimation of loss caused by natural and anthropogenic hazards. Major advancements have been made in the collaborative mapping of buildings with platforms like {OpenStreetMap}, however, many parts of the world still lack this information or the information is outdated. We created a semi-automated workflow for the development of elements-at-risk ({EaR}) databases of buildings by detecting building footprints using deep learning and characterising the footprints with building occupancy information using building morphological metrics and open-source auxiliary data. The deep learning model was used to detect building {EaR} footprints in a city in Kerala (India) with an F1 score of over 76\%. The footprints were classified into 13 building occupancy types along with information such as average number of floors, total floor space area, building density, and percentage of built-up area. We analysed the transferability of the approach to a different city in Kerala and obtained an almost similar F1 score of 74\%. We also examined the exposure of the buildings and the associated occupancies to floods using the 2018 flood susceptibility map of the respective cities. We notice certain shortcomings in our research particularly, the need for a local expert and good quality auxiliary data to obtain reasonable building occupancy information, however, our research contributes to developing a rapid method for generating a building {EaR} database in data-scarce regions with attributes of occupancy types, thus supporting regional risk assessment, disaster risk mitigation, risk reduction initiatives, and policy developments.},

	abstract = {Natural hazards can present a significant risk to road infrastructure. This infrastructure is a fundamental component of the transportation infrastructure, with significant importance. During emergencies, society heavily relies on the functionality of the road infrastructure to facilitate evacuation and access to emergency facilities. This study introduces a versatile, multi-scale framework designed to analyze accessibility within road networks during natural hazard scenarios. The first module of the framework focuses on assessing the influence of natural hazards on road infrastructure to identify damaged or blocked road segments and intersections. It relies on near real-time information, often provided by citizen science through Volunteered Geographic Information ({VGI}) data and Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) of {VGI} texts. The second module conducts network analysis based on freely available Open Street Map ({OSM}) data, differentiating between intact and degraded road networks. Four accessibility measures are employed: betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, a free-flow assumption index, and a novel alternative routing assumption measure considering congestion scenarios. The study showcases its framework through an exemplary application in California, the United States, considering different hazard scenarios, where degraded roads and connected roads impacted by the hazard can be identified. The road extraction methodology allows the extraction of 75\% to 100\% of the impacted roads mentioned in {VGI} text messages for the respective case studies. In addition to the directly extracted impacted roads, constructing the degraded network also involves finding road segments that overlap with hazard impact zones, as these are at risk of being impacted. Conducting the network analysis with the four different measures on the intact and degraded network, changes in network accessibility due to the impacts of hazards can be identified. The results show that using each measure is justified, as each measure could demonstrate the accessibility change. However, their combination and comparison provide valuable insights. In conclusion, this study successfully addresses the challenges of developing a generic, complete framework from impact extraction to network analysis independently of the scale and characteristics of road network types.},

            Deprived settlements, usually referred to as slums, are often located in hazardous areas. However, there have been very few studies to examine this notion. In this study, we leverage the advancements in open geospatial data, earth observation ({EO}), and machine learning to create a multi-hazard susceptibility index and a transferrable disaster risk approach to be adapted in low- and middle-income country ({LMIC}) cities, with low-cost methods. Specifically, we identify multi-hazards in Nairobi's selected case study area and construct a susceptibility index. Then, we test the predictability of deprived settlements using the multi-hazard susceptibility index in comparison with {EO} texture-based methods. Lastly, we survey 100 households in two deprived settlements (typical and atypical slums) in Nairobi and use the survey outcomes to validate the multi-hazard susceptibility index. To test the assumption that deprived areas are dominantly located in areas with higher susceptibility to multiple hazards, we contrast morphologically identified deprived settlements with non-deprived settlements. We find that deprived settlements are generally more exposed to hazards. However, there are variations between central and peripheral settlements. In testing the predictability of deprivation using multi-hazards, the multi-hazard-based model performs better for deprived settlements than for other classes. In contrast, the texture-based model is better at classifying all types of morphological settlements. Lastly, by contrasting the survey outcomes to the household interviews, we conclude that proxies used for the multi-hazard susceptibility index adequately capture the hazards. However, more localized proxies can be used to improve the index performance.},

              Background
              The ability of disaster response, preparedness, and mitigation efforts to assess the loss of physical accessibility to health facilities and to identify impacted populations is key in reducing the humanitarian consequences of disasters. Recent studies use either network- or raster-based approaches to measure accessibility in respect to travel time. Our analysis compares a raster- and a network- based approach that both build on open data with respect to their ability to assess the loss of accessibility due to a severe flood event. As our analysis uses open access data, the approach should be transferable to other flood-prone sites to support decision-makers in the preparation of disaster mitigation and preparedness plans.
            
            
              Methods
              Our study is based on the flood events following Cyclone Idai in Mozambique in 2019 and uses both raster- and network-based approaches to compare accessibility to health sites under normal conditions to the aftermath of the cyclone to assess the loss of accessibility. Part of the assessment is a modified centrality indicator, which identifies the specific use of the road network for the population to reach health facilities.
            
            
              Results
              Results for the raster- and the network-based approaches differed by about 300,000 inhabitants ({\textasciitilde} 800,000 to {\textasciitilde} 500,000) losing accessibility to healthcare sites. The discrepancy was related to the incomplete mapping of road networks and affected the network-based approach to a higher degree. The modified centrality indicator allowed us to identify road segments that were most likely to suffer from flooding and to highlight potential backup roads in disaster settings.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The different results obtained between the raster- and network-based methods indicate the importance of data quality assessments in addition to accessibility assessments as well as the importance of fostering mapping campaigns in large parts of the Global South. Data quality is therefore a key parameter when deciding which method is best suited for local conditions. Another important aspect is the required spatial resolution of the results. Identification of critical segments of the road network provides essential information to prepare for potential disasters.},

            In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, local and international aid organisations deploy to deliver life-saving aid to the affected population. Yet pre-disaster road maps and road transportation models do not capture disruptions to the transportation network caused by the disaster or the dynamic changes of the situation, resulting in uncertainty and inefficiency in planning and decision-making. The integration of data in near real time on the status of the road infrastructure in the affected region can help aid organisations to keep track of the rapidly shifting conditions on the ground and to assess the implications for their logistics planning and operations. In this paper, we present a rapid graph-theoretical reachability information system based on a combination of {OpenStreetMap} and open humanitarian data. The system supports logistics planning in determining road access to affected communities. We demonstrate the results of our approach in a case study on the 2018 earthquake in Papua New Guinea. Our findings show the reachability of affected communities depending on the actual status of the road network, allowing for the prioritization of targeted locations and the identification of alternative routes to get there.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Understanding the flood resilience of an area is an important task for decision-makers, practitioners, and community members. However, despite the wide acceptance of the need for resilience assessment in recent years, there has been no clear agreement on what flood resilience exactly constitutes and thus no consensus on the way in which it should be quantified. As such, this study aims to identify the most pivotal indicators to establish a standardised sustainable flood resilience framework ({SFRF}) for an overall measure of resilience before a flood event. The framework uses the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ({UN} {SDGs}) indicators as a benchmark to establish a measurement structure that can be consistently implemented globally, using publicly sourced data. Users of the {SFRF} will be able to assess whether their target area has successfully achieved the conditions required for flood resilience and as a result, the associated {UN} {SDG} targets. A detailed review of 105 journal articles related to flood resilience assessment was first conducted to identify the most frequently used indicators globally across the different frameworks in the literature. A hybrid method using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory ({DEMATEL}) approach combined with the Analytic Network Process ({ANP}) was then adopted to rank the top indicators in terms of their importance in evaluating the flood resilience. Finally, two examples are provided to show how the {SFRF} established in this study can enable users to make a universally standardised assessment of the level of flood resilience for a specific area.},

However, due to the massive geospatial data volume, heavy geometric computation, and high access concurrency, it is difficult to get response in real time. Spatial indexes are usually used in this situation. In this paper, based on k-d tree, we introduce a distributed {KD}-Tree ({DKD}-Tree) suitbable for polygon data, and a two-step query algorithm. The spatial index construction is recursive and iterative, and the query is an in memory process. Both the index and query methods can be processed in parallel, and are implemented based on {HDFS}, Spark and Redis. Experiments on a large volume of Remote Sensing images metadata have been carried out, and the advantages of our method are investigated by comparing with spatial region queries executed on {PostgreSQL} and {PostGIS}. Results show that our approach not only greatly improves the efficiency of spatial region query, but also has good scalability, Moreover, the two-step spatial range query algorithm can also save cluster resources to support a large number of concurrent queries. Therefore, this method is very useful when building large geographic information systems.},
